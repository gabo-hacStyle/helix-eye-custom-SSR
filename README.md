# Helix Eye

This is a project forked. I used it to learn how to pass  an environmnet previously set to something really new. THis situatuioon may happen in real life


Passing from the client-side-render to a server-side-render. Changed things such as the createRoot -> hydrateRoot. 

This works that the server first will rendder a first mockup or template of the app, and then JS will go and hydrate wityh react all the components.


Prefetching, which means getting data not in the client side, but fetching it in the server. This will help braowsers or IoT to not waste data ot fetch the data. We will pass it through the dom.
